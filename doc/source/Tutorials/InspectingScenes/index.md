Inspecting Scenes
=================

In the [Getting Started Tutorial](../GettingStarted/index.md) we saw that scenes are generated by nodes, and we used a variety of nodes to transform objects, apply shaders and choose render settings. But we didn't really go into any detail about how scenes are represented in the dataflow between nodes, and we relied entirely on the Viewer to see the results of our work in the form of images.

It is often necessary to inspect a scene on a more technical level than this, particularly when getting to grips with node graphs and caches delivered from upstream departments (or in the case of your humble author, when trying to understand the node graph he himself made the day before). Inspecting the scene at a technical level can also give insights into how Gaffer works and how it can be used more effectively.

This kind of detailed technical inspection is provided by the SceneInspector panel, and in this tutorial we'll be taking a brief tour through its various capabilities.
